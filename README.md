## Donamus’s Goal 
Donamus is the Latin word used for “We Give.” Our goal is to make donations more widespread and accessible by centralizing donation requests into one, easy-to-read website. Whether it would be a food bank, homeless shelter, or soup kitchen, donations are important to help lower income families and individuals. Donamus helps users identify where their extra supplies can go in order to help better their community. Users will be able to view the listings that administrators of organizations make.
